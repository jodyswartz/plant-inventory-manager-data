      "generalInformation": "Autumn/winter carrot with blunt, conical roots, approximately 15 cm long. Delicious to eat fresh, but also suitable for winter storage. Thrives best in stone-free, rich, and well-drained soil. Water during dry spells. Thin out and remove weeds when the plant is small, otherwise, it can easily become overcrowded.",
      "preCultivation": "Early, as soon as the soil can be worked - end of June. Water the furrow before sowing. 1cm deep. Keep the sowing moist. Germination time 2-4 weeks. Covering with fiber cloth after sowing promotes faster germination and prevents attacks from pests. Leave the fiber cloth on until harvest. Can also be sown in autumn, just before the soil freezes. This results in an earlier harvest the following year.",
